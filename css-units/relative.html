  <!--

  There are also relative units, which are relative to the current element's font-size or viewport size:

  em: 1em is the same as the font-size of the current element (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M.)
      The default base font-size given to web pages by web browsers before CSS styling is applied is 16 pixels, which means the
      computed value of 1em is 16 pixels for an element by default.
  -->

  <p>These paragraphs have a calculated line-height of: 2x16px = 32px.</p>
  <div>The font-size of the div element is set to 30px.
  <span>The span element inside the div element has a font-size of 0.70em, which equals to 0.70x30 = 21px</span>.</div>
